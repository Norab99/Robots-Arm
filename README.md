# Robots-Arm

This repository will include some design for robots arm.

Robot Arm - 2DOF: This file include the programing of the Robot Arm - 2DOF with arduino and two servo motors

Robot Arm - 3DOF: This file include the connection and of three stepper motors connected with arduino. Also, contains the voltage and current required for the circuit, as well as an algorithm for the assemble and the programming of the robotic arm.

Robot Arm - 6DOF: This file contains the kinematics analysis for robotic arm with six degree of freedom as well as the programming and the code for the kinematics analysis equations. Also, include an algorithm for the control pannel that will be connected to the robot arm.
