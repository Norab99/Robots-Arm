Start.
 Connect ech motor (The three motors) with the driver.
 Connect each driver (Three drivers) with the microcontroller (Arduino uno).
 Design the layout of the robotic arm. 
 Begin the programming of the robotic arm to make the control pannel.
  Choose the way of the calculation.
   - Forward Kinematics.
   - Inverse Kinematics.
  If the user choose Forward Kinematics.
   The program will ask the user to enter the joint angles and the length of each link.
    The Joint Angles:
    - Please enter the value of Theta1.
    - Please enter the value of Theta2.
    - Please enter the value of Theta3.
    Length of Each Link:
    - Please enter the value of L1.
    - Please enter the value of L2.
    - Please enter the value of L3.
   The Program will calculate the positions (X,Y) and the rotations and the orientations for the end effector (Total Theta).
   The Position and the rotation and the orientation for the end effector will appear in the screen.
   The robotics arm will move.
  If the user choose the Inverse Kinematics.
   The program will ask the user to enter the Positions and the rotations and the orientations for the end effector and length of each link.
    The Positions:
    -Please enter the value of X.
    -Please enter the value of Y.
    The Rotations and Orientations
    -Please enter the value of Totat Theta.
    Length of Each Link:
    -Please enter the value of L1.
    -Please enter the value of L2.
    -Please enter the value of L3.
   The Program will calculate the joint angles (Theta1, Theta2, Theta3).
   The joint angles will appear in the screen.
   The robotics arm will move.
 Assemble the microcontrollers and the motors with layout of the robotic arm.
 Connect the robotic arm with control pannel.
End.
