Start.
 Choose the way of the calculation.
  - Forward Kinematics.
  - Inverse Kinematics.
 If the user choose Forward Kinematics.
  The program will ask the user to enter the joint angles.
   - Please enter the value of Theta1.
   - Please enter the value of Theta2.
   - Please enter the value of Theta3.
   - Please enter the value of Theta4.
   - Please enter the value of Theta5.
   - Please enter the value of Theta6.
  The Program will calculate the positions and the rotations and the orientations for the end effector.
  The Position and the rotation and the orientation for the end effector will apear in the screen.
  The robotics arm will move.
 If the user choose the Inverse Kinematics.
